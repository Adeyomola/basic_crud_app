I created this basic CRUD app using mecallapi's API and XML AJAX.
Most of the styling was done with Bootstrap, and this was my first time using a CSS framework.
For the popups, I used the Sweet Alert2 library and for the XMLHttpRequests, I used vanilla JS.

It was fun working with more than just the GET method of the XMLHttpRequest open() method for once.
